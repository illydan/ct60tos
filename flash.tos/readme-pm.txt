CT60 patches for 1.03c firmware
-------------------------------

When I try 1.04 firmware, my Falcon is unstable and crashes, so here are
some patches from 1.04 firmware backported to 1.03c.

2009-07-08:

Added setup application.

BEWARE: Keep your current ct60tos.bin file somewhere, so you can reflash it if
it does not work for you, and must reflash it from 030 mode.


2009-06-27:

Added patch (also present in 1.04) in VT52 emulation, where setting a new
background color was not working.


2009-04-21:

Added patch (also present in 1.04) to support STMicro flash chip.
