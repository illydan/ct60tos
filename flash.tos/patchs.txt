================

sdram.S
-------
The validation of the superscalar dispatcher on the 68060 (PCR).
The initialization of the translation registers (on all 68060's 
types), the first zone mapped to 0 at $7FFFFFFF in copyback excepted for 
the zone mapped to 0 … $FFFFFF in writethrough, and the second zone mapped 
to $80000000 at $FFFFFFFF in cache inhibed.
The display of the 68060's type (revision, mask and frequency).
The modification of PCR for the bugged types revision 1.
The reading and the display of the SDRAM's type from his EEPROM. 
The declaration of the SDRAM to the TOS.
The initialization of the SDRAM, and the MB/s during writing 
displayed.
The fastram buffer created and this cookie '_FRB'.

pmmu2.c
-------
The initialization of the PMMU tree (excepted for 68060 EC or LC), 
and the possible creation of the 'PMMU' cookie. All the STRAM is in 
writethrough and the SDRAM declaration in copyback.
The possible copy of the TOS in SDRAM (excepted for 68060 EC or LC). 

cookie.S
--------
The installation of the cookies '_CPU', '_FPU', 'CT60'.

cache.S, pmmu.S, periph.S, movep.S, and movep2.S
------------------------------------------------
The patchs for cache, PMMU, adress in $00FFxxxx, and the 
instructions movep replaced.

debug.S, debug2.S
-----------------
The bombs inside exceptions displayed with texts in clear of a crash.

vector.S, vectors2.S (fpsp.S, isp.S)
------------------------------------
The emulation of unimplemented instructions (integers and FPU).

boot.S, sdram.S
---------------
The boot order patch for IDE and SCSI drives.

xbios.S, xbios2.S
-----------------
The XBIOS CT60 function $C60A to $C60D (temperature, parameters in 
flash, cache...), and the DSP (functions with handshake). 

blitter.S, blitter2.S
---------------------
The needful patchs for the blitter, the system fonts and the Atari 
logo copied at the top of the STRAM (needed if the TOS in ROM is a 4.02).
The blitter patchs of the VDI functions, vro_cpyfm, vr_trnfm, and
vrt_cpyfm for work in SDRAM (an intermediate buffer inside STRAM is used).

bios.S, bios2.S (conout.S)
--------------------------
The replacement of the XBIOS Bconout routine.

videl.S, videl2.S (pic_boot.S)
-------------------------------
The picture in 65K colors displayed during 2 seconds.

gemdos.S, gemdos2.S
-------------------
The patch for the Pexec function for the copyback (cpush after the 
relocation).
Test and alert box inside Fload for try to fix crashes with programs 
loaded without Pexec.

aes.S
-----
The AES patchs for change the Newdesk buffer of 4 KB to 32 KB.
