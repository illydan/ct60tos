About PCI...
CT60 TOS404 boot is in phase test for PCI (DMA and Interrupts not 
tested), but actually works fine on the Coldfire Evaluation Board M5484LITE. 
PCI BIOS is finished but not tested on the CT60.
PCI radeon driver is writed and tested on the Coldfire Evaluation Board M5484LITE. 
Sources in the PCI directory are also for peoples who want write 
drivers in flash. Please contact me... aniplay@wanadoo.fr

jpegsnap.acc is a snapshot tool who works in 65K and 16M colors 
compiled for the Coldfire (but works also on a 060 ;-) ), there 
are 3 modes:
 - ALT-PRINT
 - Rubberbox.
 - Top window.
